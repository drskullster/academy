# Learn more in our How-To's!

This is a powerful place on the web. Here people from around the world (like you) can share the things they've learned with others in a structured way. This tool is the heart of our open-source, collaborative community. We rely on all of you to gain knowledge from us and then share your learnings back, that way we are all solving the problem of plastic waste together!

> Pro-tip: have a look at our [How-To's](https://community.preciousplastic.com/how-to) its fun to browse around :)

# Create your own
Ok, you’ve had a look around the How-to’s, perhaps used some of them, and now you’re ready to post your own. We and everyone in the Precious Plastic community really REALLY appreciates you taking the time to document your valuable information. It's pretty basic. Let’s go through the requirements for an *awesome* How-To.


## Intro

<b>Title of your How-to:</b> is it indicative of the goal? Is it easy to understand? Remember, keep it short.

<b>Select tags for your How-to (max 4)</b> Select accurate tags, then your How-To will be found.

<b>How long does it take?</b> Helps users plan their time.

<b>Difficulty level?</b> Objective, we know! Try to select from the type of user that will be completing a How-To. Creating a basic mould from someone that has no experience will probably find it quite hard. But for a mould maker, easy.

<b>Short description of your How-to:</b> keep it to 300 characters please! Upload files: do you have CAD drawings, testing sheets, or resources that will help? Zip them in a folder and upload them here. Aim to keep it under mb.
<b>Cover photo:</b> upload a landscape photo that shows your product or process clearly. We are visual creatures, good imagery will communicate quicker than text will. Keep it to 1280x960px.

## Steps

Ok now for the good stuff. Each step needs an intro, a description and photos. You’ll need to have three steps minimum, and if you want to add more, you’ll need to click “Add Step” at the bottom.

<b>Intro:</b> again, keep it short

<b>Description:</b> edit it down to the essentials, and don’t make it a stream of text. If you have to much text for one step, it probably means your step is two big and it's better to split it up in 2 steps. This makes it easier to digest for others.
<b>Photos:</b> make sure they’re clear and useful to the step.

## Some tips & tricks:

1. <b>Titles are powerful.</b> Choose wisely, keep it short.
2. <b>Use tags,</b> that's how we stay organised - this will be how people find your How-To, so make sure they’re accurate.
3. <b>Upload minimum 3 steps</b> and make sure each step has easy to understand instructions - if it’s very long, consider splitting it into two steps.
4. <b>Try to keep it short</b> but informative - trust us, we all have short attention spans.
5. <b>Use images</b> in each step - this will help the user to visualise your instructions. Make sure your images are clear and taken with a good camera (smartphones are ok too!)
