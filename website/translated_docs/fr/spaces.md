# Precious Plastic Spaces

To help you get started on the right foot, we’ve designed and tested spaces for each of the machines with simplicity, productivity, and quality of life in mind. In the following section you’ll find a step-by-step guide with floor plans, CAD models, and tool recommendations to help you plan the various elements of your workspace.



### As you work, there are a few general things to keep in mind:

<b>1. Work together.</b> Find a teammate. Having someone to share tasks with makes the work more fun and easier to handle. It’s best if you and your teammate have complementary skillsets – engineer + businesswoman, for example.

<b>2. Customize.</b> Your context (space, location, products) will affect the way you set up your workspace. Use the plans here as a starting point, and always be on the lookout for ways that you can adapt them to better suit your needs.

<b>3. Keep it simple.</b> We recommend starting with the most basic elements of your workspace (machine, workbench, basic tools) and building out from there as you start to work with your machine. This way, you’ll build and buy only what suits your needs.

<b>4. Welcoming.</b> Your workspace is more than a recycling center - it’s a tool for cultural change. Take care of the little details to make it an enjoyable place to be for you, your team, and visitors who pass by.
